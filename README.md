🔍 RAG + Agent + Memory with LangChain (Interstellar Dataset)
This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline enhanced with an agent system and conversational memory using LangChain.

We use a sample text about the movie Interstellar, and build an agent that can:

Answer questions using context from the text (RAG)

Do real-time web searches (DuckDuckGo)

Perform mathematical operations (Calculator Tool)

Remember past interactions (Memory)

📌 Features
✅ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (FAISS + HuggingFace + Cohere Rerank)

✅ LangChain Agent with Tool Routing (ReAct format)

✅ Integrated memory for conversation continuity

✅ Real-time search using DuckDuckGo

✅ Calculator tool using LLM-math

✅ Compatible with OpenAI + Cohere APIs
